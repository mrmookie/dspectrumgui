## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open an issue. This isn't a production / public facing tool, and it can be run in a VM in isolation (with a local only connection) as it doesn't interface directly with any SDR/RF hardware to mitigate risks. If you found a vuln, chances are someone else has too. Add it in as an issue here for all to see so I'm pressured to do something about it =P
That said - this application isn't intended to have a high security maturity. I'll certainly make an effort to fix things where possible.
Feel empowered to help me out by submitting a pull request for a fix. If it seems sound and doesn't break anything, I'll pull it into the codebase.

Thanks xD
